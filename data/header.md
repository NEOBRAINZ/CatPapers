## Cat Paper Collection

As reported by Cisco, 90% of net traffic will be visual, and indeed, most of the visual data are cat photos and videos. Thus, understanding, modeling, and synthesizing our feline friends becomes a more and more critical research problem these days, especially for our cat lovers.

**Cat Paper Collection** is an academic paper collection that includes computer graphics, computer vision, and machine learning papers that produce experimental results related to **cats**.
